## Lord of the Objects Project

- Week 2 homework for Skill Distillery Java bootcamp.
- Lord of the Objects.

### Overview

Welcome to Mario 1981!

This is a java-based game that allows the user to navigate a linear game.
The player must fight Mario themed enemies who have health and attack damage. The user has 4 available commands, which respond differently per each opponent.
The game continues until user defeats all 3 enemies or is defeated themselves.  Upon victory, Mario rescues the princess.
The game has implemented simple strategies that makes it a challenge to find which attack is most effective against an enemy.
Each time an enemy is hit, it will strike back, unless it is defeated. The enemies have random attack responses to make the game less predictable.

Enjoy!

### Lessons Learned

In creating this project, I was able to take the things that I had learned in the second week of my Skill Distillery bootcamp, and implement them all together on a cohesive way.  Using inheritance and encapsulation strategically have become easier through working on this project.  Experimenting with how they work helped with my confidence in moving forward on more intricate projects.  Inheritance is incredibly useful and helped us remove a lot of potentially redundant code.

I also learned how to work on a larger project with others a better.  We learned how to divide the work in a professional way.  We chose to work on different parts of the project, instead of working on the same class at the same time.  This also helped us show each other our strengths which helped us both understand all of the concepts we were working with better.


### Attack Plan

My programming partner, Josh, and I first created a UML diagram to layout a linear game structure and to identify the classes, methods, and variables we would be using.  We then took the classes and set them up in a way that we could take advantage of inheritance and minimize the amount of duplicated work.  Through encapsulation, we were able to secure our work and make our field variables protected so only our package would be able to access them.  

Once we had the different classes set up, we were able to create a main method with the game flow and instantiate various objects to take on properties of their different classes so we could use them in our game.  Once we had the main outline structured and all the objects instantiated, we could focus on the storyline, the user experience, and some of our stretch goals.

### Wish List Additions

* Adding emojis for a brighter user experience.
* Creating an array so the user would have a map to move around.
* Adding more items to create more attack and defensive options, and creating an entire collection of classes for these items.
* The option to unlock new attack options, or a way to level up attacks.

### Unique features that we added

* Critical hit options for main character and enemy attacks.
* The possibility for all attacks to miss which increased the players experience.
* Attack moves have varying damages based on the enemy they are used on.
* Varying storylines based on which attacks are used.
